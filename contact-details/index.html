                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is <strong>Cary de Silva</strong> and I'm a <strong><abbr id="Driving Standards Agency">DSA
                </abbr> grade A driving instructor</strong> (that's the best you can be) with 7+ years
                    experience teaching people to drive, and I'm the owner of Genesis Driving School.</p>
                <p>I try to make my driving lessons as relaxed and friendly as possible and that seems to work, as I've
                    managed to achieve <strong>very high pass rates</strong>. I always try to be as flexible as possible
                    with lesson times and pick-ups and I can probably work around your busy schedule.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions, or would like to have an informal chat, please do get in touch.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, <a href="/student-feedback" title="Genesis Driving School student feedback">see what
                    some of my
                    students thought about their driving lessons!</a></p>
